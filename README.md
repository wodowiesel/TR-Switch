# TR-Switch

The TX/RX-switch is a tool for signal sensitive or PTT switching for HAM radios incl. pcb schematics.


## DISCLAIMERS

**This is still "work-in-progress (WIP)" so I do NOT take any kind of responsibility for damages/data losses!**

**You can use this at your own risk without guarantees and put device on non conductive surface or enclosure!**

If you like the new design yo are free to share it!

Have fun :)
